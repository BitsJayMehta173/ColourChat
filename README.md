# ColourChat

A new Encryption Technique for Messaging Eliminating Mathematical Approach Rather Using The Small World Network Efficiency.

For Now I have Just Made A Trash Draft Just To prove my point

First We Scan The QR Code and make a common language Book for A chat.
As We needed No network Connection To establish the language book No one except the device Knows the Language for Chat.

What Ever you Type will be encoded with the Language Book and sent No original Data will be shared and while the reciever has the same language book he can decrypt it so basically it turns to keyless Transmission.

Now I am implementing Small World Network to connect devices which are far away.

The situation here is as the users grow we see the link between any two user is less than 6 link which makes it easier for any user to connect with another.
